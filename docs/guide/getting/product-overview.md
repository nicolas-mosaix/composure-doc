{% capture overview %}

Composure is a Multi-Cloud Optimizer (CCO) software from Composure.ai. Composure provides composable services atop various clouds, including AWS, OpenStack, Docker, Azure, KVM, bare metal and virtualized environments. It then optimizes those services for efficiency, performance and security. Developers get on-demand access to cloud services, while the ops team gets transparency into intent, usage and cost. Ops also gets cost savings and site-reliability from workload placement, autoscaling and load-balancing that are sensitive to business constraints and the polydimensional nature of cloud infrastructure. The composable clouds enabled by Composure can be within a single cloud, or span a hybrid/multi-cloud environment. Composure inserts itself seamlessly into an environment, delivers value quickly and grows operational agility and scale from the start.

Composure is AI-powered. Underpinning the artificial intelligence is a knowledge-graph called the Cloud Graph. It uses composition, discovery, listening and monitoring to organize all information about your clouds. This knowledge base graph then feeds the optimization of cloud services.

-  **Cloud Composer**: Developers self-serve their cloud services needs through Cloud Composer. They simply express their desired outcomes in simple YAML-based AppSpec file. Cloud Composer leverages Composure.aiâ€™s Service Resolvers, a breakthrough that deftly abstracts infrastructure, and which allows developers the ability to easily extend to new services.

- **Cloud Optimizer**: Ops gets autonomic control over services in production through the Cloud Optimizer. Unlike existing orchestrators and cluster-managers, it employs several breakthroughs to fully consider all performance variables and business-level constraints for secure, performant and efficient workloads. Cost savings enabled by the Cloud Optimizer can be considerable.
